<string name="intro_text">Recontrol is an application to remotely control and
                          track your phone.  It uses Android Cloud to Device
                          Messaging to send messages that will invoke a GPS
                          locator, Web download, or JavaScript file on your
                          phone.  To continue, you will need to allow access
                          to your Google account.  If you have more than one
                          account, you will be prompted to select one.
                          &lt;p>
                          The ability to download any file and invoke
                          JavaScript gives you the power to do absolutely
                          anything allowed by Android on your phone through a
                          remote service.
